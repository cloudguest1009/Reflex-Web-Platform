## Payment Integration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

The Razorpay payment gateway is now fully integrated with the following features:

**Complete Payment Flow:**
1. âœ… User enters amount in INR on Contact page
2. âœ… Clicks "Pay Now" button â†’ Creates Razorpay order via backend
3. âœ… Razorpay checkout popup opens automatically with order details
4. âœ… User completes payment using Razorpay's secure interface
5. âœ… Success/failure callbacks capture payment details (payment_id, order_id, signature)
6. âœ… Backend verifies payment signature for security
7. âœ… User sees confirmation message with payment status

**Technical Implementation:**
- Razorpay SDK installed and configured
- Order creation API integrated with error handling
- Checkout.js script loaded in head_components
- JavaScript payment initialization function with proper callbacks
- Payment success/failure event handlers in Reflex state
- Payment signature verification for security
- Transaction details stored in state (payment_id, order_id, status)

**Next Steps for Production:**
1. Replace placeholder API keys with actual Razorpay credentials:
   - Set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` environment variable (e.g., `rzp_test_xxxxx` for test mode)
   - Set `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` environment variable
2. Test with Razorpay test keys before going live
3. Switch to live keys for production deployment
4. Configure webhook endpoints for payment notifications (optional)
